# SMSUsingSpringMVC
Students Management System Using Spring Model View and Controller
This Spring MVC project is a Java-based web application built using the Spring Framework's Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. In this Spring MVC project:

- **Model:** Represents the application's data and business logic.
- **View:** Handles the presentation layer and generates the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages the flow of requests and acts as an intermediary between the model and view.

Spring MVC offers features like request mapping, data binding, validation, and internationalization, making it a popular choice for developing scalable and maintainable web applications. It's often used for building web applications, RESTful APIs, and more, providing a structured and organized approach to web development in Java.
